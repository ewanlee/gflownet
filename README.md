# Trajectory Balance: Improved Credit Assignment in GFlowNets

Implementation for [trajectory balance paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13259) for grid environment in the [GFlownet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04399), based on this [gist](https://gist.github.com/malkin1729/9a87ce4f19acdc2c24225782a8b81c15).

## Grid experiments

Requirements for base experiments: 
- `torch numpy scipy tqdm`

## Grid experiments

- `cd gflownet/grid`
- `python toy_grid_dag_tb.py --progress`
